# Specification

## 1 game for SP

- AR is visual => Not the focus for the kids to learn bc it should be **sound**
- Sound => voice recognition, sound distinguishing feature to separate by source
- SOS (Animated  Sources Of Sound like Pokemon GO)
  - Animals
  - Machines (Car etc.)
- We have a map
  - We need to map the school
- We're going to place SOSs in certain (geo)locations where the child is operating (like school)
- Child can choose difficulty (via bat and number of SOSs)

## Mini games

- Captcha-game
  - Sound is given
  - Pick the according tile form the grid

## User journey (Kids)

1. Kid has tablet
2. Kid opens app
3. Kid signs in or is already signed in
   1. If it is the first time playing

4. Main game
   1. The kid sees a WAVE-display of a sound with a name in sign-language
   2. Instructions on finding the SOS is given by the mascot via sign-language
   3. Then the kid has to "follow" the sound to reach its source
      1. If distance increases volume decreases
      1. If distance decreases volume increases
   4. The kid has found the source
   5. The kid sees a 3D-representation of the SOS in AR-space
   6. The kid has to tap it to collect it
   7. Win the captcha-game (or duo-lingo speaking exercise for future...speaking-scope)
   8. The mascot celebrates the kid
   9. JMP to i.

### Multiplayer

#### Exact same idea as SP BUT

- AR becomes VR
- Optionally cou can play the game in 2D-mode (and move on the map)
- The player sees the other connected players moving in realtime
- Sign-language chat and voice-chat in the future
