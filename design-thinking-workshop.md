## Example-Project

POV

User: Dina Parker (Teacher)

needs a way to:

- Framework of teaching the kids about identifying and organising (according to the local trash mgmt. system) waste where the lessons are 30mins
- Keep the children's attention-span

<!-- - Involve the parents into the process -->
<!-- (Too restrictive!) -->

because:

- There was an incident with a nail which can be dangerous
- The kids are not able to separate trash
- she wants to help the kids become good members of society
- Avoid fines in the future (Grown-up)

but:

- Technology should not play a role in the teaching-process
- the kids
  - cannot read
  - Have different kinds of mindsets
  - Have a small attention span.

## Brainstorming

- Addressing attention span
  - Music Playing tools (Not producing) using technology
    - Ambient music
  - Voice-over video

- Parents do a play (Setting an example)
- Gamification
  - Reward system
  - Rank
