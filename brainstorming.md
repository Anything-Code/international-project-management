# Brainstorming

## Prerequisites

1. Kids have to learn how to understand sound
2. Kids have to learn how to speak
3. Only one game
   1. **BUT** a game can have mini-games right?
   2. Or we can combine the ideas into one game
      1. Bat is explaining "hello kids there are some tasks you have to do now"
      2. Bat is using sign-language
      3. "go clean the room" (They can get a trasher-certificate)
      4. "Buy me groceries"

## Some game scenarios that consider the [POVs](./point-of-view.md)

1. Repeating the sounds of the image/video and saying it back (like duo-lingo)
2. Introduction to positive-reinforcement (Generous point-distribution-policy)

## Process

1. Open App
2. Choose on game (In sign language)
3. Dry-run of game (Tutorial-section with the mascot)

## General

- Content like...rhymes bc kids like rhymes
- Content like...animals

## Ideas by Mr. MÃ¶ckel

- Advent callander
- Behind each door you could hav
  - A sound
  - A video
- Great opportunity to teach the kids numbers from 0 to 24
- Petterson und Findus as an example
- Maybe use the SBBZ-school as a picture as an asset in the game

## Main game idea

- Pokemon-GO-like
- Tutorials about
  - The game structure
  - Usage
  - Sounds -> objects
- Single-Player
  - Help
    - Grievance-section
    - Question in general
      - In the form of video-message
    - Sign-language-chat with video-input recognising the signs and putting it as icons/glyphs into the chat
  - Hints within the game
    - Objects in the center of AR-space (also tap it)
      - Hear sound
      - See sign language representation
  - Daily challenges
    - Kids are given tasks in the form of sounds and then they have to find the right objects in the real world...with AR
      - Hints if the kids don't get it right away in the form of sign-language (f.e. It has four legs and you can st on it (chair, horse))
    - Also in the form of mini-games
  - But you capture sounds not pokemon...
    - To catch them...you have to play a mini-game
      - Image of an object pops up
      - Child has to find it
      - To capture it...play a mini-game
  - In this scenario we can use SP, MP
  - **Singleplayer** = AR as an app on the Tablet
  - **Multiplayer** = In the browser not AR but you can visit remote places
    - Sign-language chat
    - Objects and the kids see the other (Avatars) at the current object that they are working on (include a **map-feature**)
      - Map feature locations accessible by supervisors
    - Playing through the mini-games together when working on the same object (Partner-feature (COOP))
    - Other schools (**future**)
      - Kids can visit other schools virtually with their avatar
        - On the map 2D (Could run inside the browser)
        - With 3D-Goggles visit the schools in 3D-space (VR-Game)

### World

- School
- Garden

### Actors

- Mascot
- Animals

## Mini-games

- A game like charades [**Explaining** they cant do this, Draw, Mimic] (Use content by parents) (Multiplayer only)
- Someone will mimic an action and the kids have to guess the action [by speaking] (Interactivity, memory, quiz)
  - But the input that the kids receive is visual
  - Answer is repeated in speech
- I spy with my little eye (but with ear)
  - Play a sound
  - The kids have to guess that sound by either choosing, typing or saying the answer
- Pokemon GO (AR) but with sound
  - Noises from the real world
    - Classroom, playground...familiar surroundings
    - Teachers, Parents can upload assets
  - Kids head towards the source of the sound they get one point
- Karaoke with children-songs (Older-kids so...later)
- Where is wally...but with different assets (sounds)
  - Provide sound of...anything
  - They click on the correct item
    - The bat will come and congratulate them :)
  - They click on the wrong item
    - The bat will bite them :(
      - They get corona :'(
