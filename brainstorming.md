# Brainstorming

## Prerequisites

1. Kids have to learn how to understand sound
2. Kids have to learn how to speak
3. Only one game
   1. **BUT** a game can have mini-games right?
   2. Or we can combine the ideas into one game
      1. Bat is explaining "hello kids there are some tasks you have to do now"
      2. Bat is using sign-language
      3. "go clean the room" (They can get a trasher-certificate)
      4. "Buy me groceries"

## Some game scenarios that consider the [POVs](./point-of-view.md)

1. Repeating the sounds of the image/video and saying it back (like duo-lingo)
2. Introduction to positive-reinforcement (Generous point-distribution-policy)

## Process

1. Open App
2. Choose on game (In sign language)
3. Dry-run of game (Tutorial-section with the mascot)

## General

- Content like...rhymes bc kids like rhymes
- Content like...animals

## Ideas by Mr. MÃ¶ckel

- Advent callander
- Behind each door you could hav
  - A sound
  - A video
- Great opportunity to teach the kids numbers from 0 to 24
- Petterson und Findus as an example
- Maybe use the SBBZ-school as a picture as an asset in the game

## Main game idea

- Pokemon-like
  - But you capture sounds not pokemon...
    - To catch them...you have to play a mini-game
  - In this scenario we can use SP, MP
  - **Singleplayer** = AR as an app on the Tablet
  - **Multiplayer** = In the browser not AR but you can visit remote places
- Platformer

### World

- School
- Garden

### Actors

- Mascot
- Animals

## Mini-games

- A game like charades [**Explaining** they cant do this, Draw, Mimic] (Use content by parents) (Multiplayer only)
- Someone will mimic an action and the kids have to guess the action [by speaking] (Interactivity, memory, quiz)
  - But the input that the kids receive is visual
  - Answer is repeated in speech
- I spy with my little eye (but with ear)
  - Play a sound
  - The kids have to guess that sound by either choosing, typing or saying the answer
- Pokemon GO (AR) but with sound
  - Noises from the real world
    - Classroom, playground...familiar surroundings
    - Teachers, Parents can upload assets
  - Kids head towards the source of the sound they get one point
- Karaoke with children-songs (Older-kids so...later)
- Where is wally...but with different assets (sounds)
  - Provide sound of...anything
  - They click on the correct item
    - The bat will come and congratulate them :)
  - They click on the wrong item
    - The bat will bite them :(
      - They get corona :'(
